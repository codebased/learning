## VS Code Extensions

* [Azure Logic App Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-logicapps)

## Presentation

Idea behind is to write a presentation using code first approach. It can be achieved using Marp.

You can write a code in VSCode and preview using normal markdown option. However you will need to install a [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode).

For more details about `Marp`, please refer [this](https://marp.app/#get-started) link and for documentation please refer [this](https://marpit.marp.app/markdown) link.
